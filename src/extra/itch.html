<p>Help this little green monster in reaching the end of each level. Avoid deadly obstacles such as cactuses, birds,
    snakes and scorpios. Don't even ask why she is constantly running.</p>
<p>T-Rex 64 offers 14 action packed levels in 3 distinct worlds, dedicated music, joystick and keyboard support. This
    single file game works well with real machines and emulators, any CBM disk drive or tape, including SD2IEC and Easy
    Flash.</p>
<p>Both PAL and NTSC machines are supported, except for the very early 6567R56A, 64 cycles per raster models. If you
    have any problems with this particular VIC-II model, please post a comment below and I'll try to fix it.<br></p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
    Jump or duck to avoid obstacles.
    Any contact is extremely unpleasant and decrements your precious spare life amount.

<h2>Requirements and running the game</h2>
<p>You need a Commodore 64 / 128 machine or an appropriate emulator to play the game. We deliver a bundle of PRG and D64
    files.<br></p>
<p> Easiest way to run the game on PC is to use Vice emulator to run PRG executable: <br></p>
<p><code>x64 rex.prg</code> </p>
<p> Use D64 image to run T-Rex on real Commodore 64. Copy the file to the USB drive / SD card and use it with Ultimate
    1541 or SD2EIC. Once mounted, the game can be loaded simply by:</p>
<p><code>LOAD"*",8</code></p>
<p><code>RUN</code></p>
<p>For really classy experience you can also transfer D64 directly into 5.25 floppy disk and run it
    from 1541. </p>
